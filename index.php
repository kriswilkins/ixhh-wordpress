            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Nine Hostage House is a vision to breathe life into living history, through the creation of crafts and community.
                Celebrating each of our group's individual artisans, our Tudor style village serves as a setting to foster traditional works and creations. 
                Craftspeople practice and pass skills on to newer artists, who find joy in creating with their hearts and hands, rebuking modern manufacturing. <br><br>
                We are committed to cultivating an inclusive space where knowledge flows freely between mentors and apprentices, where the traditional arts of leatherwork, woodturning, brewing, sewing, textile creation, and countless other crafts flourish under careful stewardship. <br><br>
                Living History. Through immersive experiences, hands-on classes, and festive gatherings within our themed setting, we seek to honor the ingenuity of pre-industrial craftspeople while building a modern community bound together by shared curiosity, creative expression, and the enduring human desire to make something beautiful and lasting with the distinctive spirit.
                We are proud to uphold our motto, <br><br> “TRUTH - LOVE - HONOR”</p>
